              After struggling with my child and his anger issues
              and quick temper I have seen the light which this
              wonderful program offers. I canâ€™t recommend it enough
              for anyone who has anyone with difficult issues.

              This program has a ton of great information that
              really helps parents understand our role in continuing
              the dance of arguments we are constantly engaging with
              our kiddos. Awareness is a huge step!

            <Testimonial img = {datrickIm} name = {'Patrick Zaval'} position = 'text-lg-right'>
              This is a great program and eye opening, Easy to
              follow. I have listened to it many times and learn
              something new each time. Excellent source for any
              parent who is looking for a calm approach to
              parenting.
